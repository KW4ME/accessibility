## Overview

This website has been refactored to meet accessibility standards, ensuring a more inclusive and user-friendly experience. The following changes have been implemented to enhance accessibility:

## Changes Made

Semantic HTML Elements:

The source code now incorporates semantic HTML elements throughout, improving both code readability and accessibility. Semantic elements such as &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;main&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, &lt;aside&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt; have been appropriately used.

## Logical Structure:

HTML elements have been organized in a logical structure that remains independent of styling and positioning. This ensures that users relying on assistive technologies can navigate the content seamlessly.
Accessible Alt Attributes:

All image and icon elements now include descriptive and accessible alt attributes. This provides meaningful information to users who may be using screen readers or have images disabled.
Sequential Heading Attributes:

Heading attributes have been adjusted to follow a sequential order (&lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;, &lt;h3&gt;, etc.), enhancing the document structure and making it easier for users to navigate the content.
Concise Title Elements:

The &lt;title&gt;element has been updated to contain a concise and descriptive title, providing users with clear information about the content and purpose of the webpage.
